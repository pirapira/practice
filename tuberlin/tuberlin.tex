\begin{frame}{What is Ethereum}

\begin{itemize}
\item replicated
\item no central parties
\end{itemize}

How does Ethereum synchronize execution traces?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Blockchain}
is just a data strucuture.

a picture of trees.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proof of Work}

\alert{by here, the work mining has to be described}

If you succeed create a block:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the block reward is only spendable in chains that include your block
\item you should send around blocks (assumption: rationality of nodes)
\end{enumerate}

If you see a block being sent around:
\begin{enumerate}
\item if that's the best block you've seen, you should try to mine on the block (assumption: rationality and other nodes' good behavior)
\item you should broadcase the block you are mining on (assumption: rationality and other nodes' good behavior)
\end{enumerate}

Does it work?  Yes, see Bitcoin.

Why?  I don't know, honestly.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Evaluating Proof of Work}

No good properties distributed-computation-wise.

(A good protocol can usually stand < 1/3 of nodes being Byzantine.)

\structure{One Byzantine node can}
\begin{itemize}
\item be lucky enough to guess the secret keys of all public keys it sees.
\end{itemize}

\structure{One (economically) irrational node can}
\begin{itemize}
\item buy lots of machines to mine quicker than anybody, rewriting the history from any point.
\end{itemize}

\structure{Anything better possible?}
Maybe not much because one party can play many nodes.

\structure{What about counting the monetary bounty instead of number of nodes?}
That could work.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Proof-of-stake}
\begin{itemize}
\item bonded validators
\item ``nothing-at-stake problem''
\item slashing wrong-doing
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Some definitions}
When I was in Paris I received the following definitions.

Being unsure what it meant, I turned to Alloy.
